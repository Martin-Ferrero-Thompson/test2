A Proposal for Partnership

An epic 1,685km solo cycling challenge across the Pyrenees and back to fund vital research for Guillain-Barré Syndrome.

[PAGE 2: THE PROPOSAL]

An Invitation to Join an Extraordinary Journey
In September 2026, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) survivor Martin Thompson will embark on a monumental solo cycling challenge. Over 21 days, he will climb nearly 35,000 metres while traversing the entire Pyrenean mountain range from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and back again.

This is The Slow Road Back—a heartfelt mission to raise critical awareness and funds for the GBS community, born from a personal story of resilience, recovery, and the unwavering support of a loved one.

This document is an invitation to partner with us. By supporting this challenge, your brand will become associated with a powerful, authentic story of human endurance, hope, and international collaboration. We are seeking partners who believe in the power of setting audacious goals and making a tangible difference.

Join us.

[PAGE 3: OUR STORY]

The Heart of the Campaign
This journey began not on a road, but in a hospital bed. In August 2021, Martin, a passionate long-distance cyclist, was struck down by Guillain-Barré Syndrome. The rare autoimmune disorder attacked his nervous system, leaving him paralysed from the waist down and facing a terrifyingly uncertain future.

The road to recovery was the hardest climb of his life. It was a slow, painful, and deeply personal battle fought every day in rehab, learning to stand and then to walk again. Throughout this time, his partner Edurne was his constant support from her home in Spain, a daily lifeline across the distance, symbolizing the crucial role that family and loved ones play in every GBS story.

Now, living in Pamplona, Martin is not just recovered; he is redefined. His journey has given him a new perspective: that the 'slow road back' is not a sign of weakness, but a source of incredible strength and appreciation. This challenge is the ultimate expression of that recovery. It is a mission to give back, to fund the research that will create better outcomes for future patients, and to prove what is possible.

Edurne will not be riding alongside him, but her role is as vital as ever. She will be there to see him off at the start and, most importantly, be the first to greet him at the finish line, symbolizing the love and support that fuels every single pedal stroke.

The Journey Home (Return): A long test of endurance across the Spanish side, tackling the remote and beautiful roads of Catalunya, Aragón, and finally, a triumphant return through Navarra.
